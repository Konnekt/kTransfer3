						 Version 2.0.0 RC1, 18th of August 2006
********************************************************************************
- Fixed lots of bugs in the WidgetModalDialog logic.
  You can now actually have an application consisting of only WidgetModalDialogs
  without being afriad of that your application is gonna die under suspicious
  circumstances!


********************************************************************************
						 Version 2.0.0 RC1, 23th of July 2006
********************************************************************************
- Added get/setTextLimit to WidgetTextBox

- Breaking change!
  WidgetLoadFile/WidgetSaveFile "startDirectory" method changed
  to "setStartDirectory" for consistency
  
- Added setStartDirectory method to WidgetChooseFolder

- Fixed bug in setSmallIcon would make the icon a appear a little blurry

- Added invalidateWidget method which only invalidates the window and doesn't repaint it.

- Fixed bug in the getBounds/getPosition methods, which would not give the
  relative position for child widgets
  
- Fixed bug in WidgetLoadFile which would give a memory access error
  if all parameters were not set

- Added the showDialogMultiSelect method to the WidgetLoadFile, to allow
  multiple selections. Thanks Mike M.!

- Added the AspectBorder to most widgets. This aspect adds the following methods:
  setBorder - set normal solid border
  setSunkenBorder - like in text boxes
  setSmoothSunkenBorder - like in some read-only text boxes
  setRaisedBorder - like buttons

- Fixed bug
  Code using WidgetWindowBase's setMinimizeBox wouldn't compile

- Added icon support to WidgetDataGrid and WidgetTreeView.
  You need to make an image list (see the new class ImageList), add icons
  to it, and then associate the image list to the widget.
  When adding rows / nodes, specify the index of the icon in the associated
  image list to be shown on it, in the iconIndex parameter. Use -1 if you don't
  want to use an icon.

- Breaking change!
  WidgetToolbar now uses ImageList's. The addBitmap method was deprecated.
  So, e.g, instead of:
	toolbar->addBitmap( BITMAP_ID, 5 );
  use:
	ImageListPtr imageList( new SmartWin::ImageList( 32, 32, ILC_COLOR24 ) );
	imageList->addMultiple( SmartWin::Bitmap( BITMAP_ID ) );
	toolbar->setImageList( imageList );

- Added methods on WidgetDataGrid:
  setView - changes the view between Report, Icon, Small Icon, and List
  setAlwaysShowSelection - makes the selection always visible

- AspectBackgroundColorDispatcher modified logic to allow process by the
  original handler

- WidgetTabSheet::addPage now returns unsigned int (the negative values returned
  by the operative system are already taken care by throwing)

- Added WidgetTabSheet::getUsableArea

- Added support for tstringstream, etc in addition to tstring.

- Added Application::generateLocalClassName, Application::setSystemClassName, and
  Application::addLocalWindowClassToUnregister to manage window class registration.

- Added cropTop, cropBottom, cropLeft, cropRight, and FromRECT to Rectangle.

- Renamed the onCustomDraw in WidgetDataGrid to onCustomPainting.

- OS events!
  It is now posible to add up events for e.g. process exited or files in directory
  changed etc.
  See the TicTacToe or the BoostSignals sample for an example.

- New Aspect!
  Many Widgets now support "onChar" which is especially useful in WidgetTextBoxes
  for doing "custom filtering" of characters.
  Return false and the character won't be added to the text of the textbox!

- Breaking change!
  Renamed the NormalWidget, DialogWidget, ModalDialogWidget and the
  MessageMapPolicyMDIChildWidget
  classes which is used as "policy" classes to the MessageMap to:
  * MessageMapPolicyNormalWidget
  * MessageMapPolicyDialogWidget
  * MessageMapPolicyModalDialogWidget
  * MessageMapPolicyMDIChildWidget
  These are long names and probably will take some time to become acquainted with
  but I think (and hope) that users will aknowledge that the names are more
  intuitive and understanding since they're more descriptive...

- Renamed some of the template parameters e.g. Parent wnd WidgetOriginalType is
  now called EventHandlerWidget since this is a more and better descriptive name.

********************************************************************************
						 Version 2.0.0 BETA, 22th of March 2006
********************************************************************************

- Fixed bug in Place::positionToRight that created a new row even when widget
  size was bigger than the available space per row.

- Added library called SmartSOAP
  SmartSOAP is a new extension to SmartWin which can do among other things SOAP
  calls or consume WebServices through usage of the SOAP and HTTP protocol.
  Look in the SmartSOAPTester1 for an example of how to use the library!
  SmartSOAP is yet in an experimental state meaning it might change in future
  versions, but the basics are roughly as they probably will be in later
  versions so this shouldn't scare you away from using it!
  In addition the SmartSOAP contains helper classes for doing string conversion
  to and from UNICODE plus it contains helper classes for parsing Dates
  and manipulating Dates through the DateTime class and the TimeSpan class.
  It also contains HttpRequest/Response classes, TcpStreambuffer classes
  and lots of goodies!
  But the docs are bad and some parts of the library might change in future
  versions, but this is definitively something we will support "for ever"!!

- Fixed bug in AspectBackgroundColorDispatcher that prevented global/static
  functions from taking care of the background color.

- Breaking change!
  Since RadioButtons now actually are children of WidgetGroupBoxes (and not just
  faked) the setSize (and its sizing/positioning functions) will work relatively
  within the WidgetGroupBox.
  Before you had to set the size relatively according to the WidgetContainer
  the group box was within!
  So if your radiobuttons have disappeared this is probably the reason since
  this will make radiobuttons scroll OUT of the visible area of the Group Box!!

- You no longer need to explicitly link towards neither comctl32.lib nor
  SmartWinxx.lib if using VC++.
  Both of these files are included automatically through compiler directives
  in VC++ compilers!

- (Deprecation): the use of CreationalStruct and all of the functions
  getDefaultXxxCreationalStruct has been deprecated in favor of Seed (see next
  point).

- Every widget has now a class member named Seed. It contains all of the information
  needed to successfully create a Widget. All widgets, but WidgetWindow, have set,
  at least, WS_CHILD and WS_VISIBLE by default. WidgetWindow::Seed::style is
  WS_VISIBLE | WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW set by default. The data members of Seed will be
  tweaked until the official release.

- WidgetChildWindow is no longer a typedef in the factory but a class derivated from
  WidgetWindow. Its constructor requires a pointer to a parent Widget.

- (Breaking change): WidgetWindow::create now takes only one parameter (its Seed). By
  default, it will produce a non-child window. Use WidgetChildWindow to get child
  windows, for example:
	  MyClass : WidgetFactory< WidgetChildWindow, MyClass >

- (Breaking change): createFont is not longer defined inside of the factory. Now, it
  is a global function. Thus, MyWidgetPtr->createFont won't compile.

- The initial fonts of some widgets has been changed to a non - bitmap font.

- (Breaking change) All Widgets (or most of them) have now got protected
  constructors which means that if you need to create a new Widget outside a
  WidgetFactory you need to do it by using the WidgetCreator class with the template
  parameter of the WidgetType you wish.

- Added new function (alphaBlend) in CoorUtilities class which does basic alpha
  blending of RGB values on pixel level.
  Note that function is NOT very optimized and especially on slow platforms alternative solutions (like GDI+) should be considered!

- Added up a new Widget called WidgetCoolbar which is an implementation of the
  ReBar control in Windows API.
  Contains basic (though unfinished) support for a Coolbar control.

- Fixed bug in WidgetDataGrid when using the onCustomDraw Event Handler that
  made the text of column 0 become invisible if text was not left aligned.
  (Thanx to flix01)

- Added new function to WidgetDataGrid called setBackgroundColor which changes
  the background color property of the rows that DOES NOT have any items.

- Added new function in AspectSizable which guarantees that the Widget will NOT
  be obscured by other widgets in "front" of it in the same container widget
  Function is called bringToFront.

- Made it possible to embed WidgetChildWidget in WidgetDialog and
  WidgetModalDialog

- Made itsChildren in Widget protected to make inherited widgets be able to
  reach it.

- Fixed bug with Windows Mobile (CE5.x) which made the SIP not always show up

- Made all the "create" function virtual to make overriding possible

- Implemented AspectThreads in WidgetWindowBase instead of WidgetWindow to make
  it possible to do threading from Widget(Modal)Dialogs



********************************************************************************
						 Version 1.0.2, 24th of October 2005
********************************************************************************
- Changed license from the GPL derived license to a "pure" BSD license.

- AspectFocus is implemented in WidgetWindowBase meaning both Dialogs and normal
  container Widgets can handle the Focus event and set focus without resorting
  to pure Windows API.

- AspectFocus is implemented in WidgetStatic meaning focus can be given and
  the Focus and KillFocus Event can be handled in WidgetStatic

- Fixed bug in updateWidget which would not always make the window be repainted
  when called

- Fixed bug which would in rare occasions make the onSelectionChanged fire
  multiple times for one Event in WidgetDataGrid.




********************************************************************************
						 Version 1.0.1, 10th of September 2005
********************************************************************************
- Fixed bug in AspectText which made it impossible to handle the onTextChanged
  Event in any Widget.
  This changed the Event Handler signature to "const SmartUtil::tstring &" instead of just
  "SmartUtil::tstring &"
  In addition the Event Handler Setter has been renamed from onSetText to
  onTextChanging

- Fixed bug in WidgetCheckBox which made it impossible to handle the onDblClick
  Event.


********************************************************************************
	Conversion between Version 0.99 and Version 1.0, September 21, 2005
********************************************************************************


Here are some errors that you will run into if you have 0.99 source and you try
to rebuild with the 1.00 SmartWin++:


: error C2061: syntax error : identifier 'WidgetList'

1.00 changed the name to be WidgetDataGrid, so
	replace all WidgetList with WidgetDataGrid
	replace all createList with createDataGrid


: error C2039: 'WindowSizedEventResult' : is not a member of 'SmartWin'

:  to 'SmartWin::WidgetMenu<Parent,MessageMapPolicy>::itsVoidMenuFunctionTakingUInt'

probably you need to change the definition of the response function from:
void MainWindow::menuClicked( WidgetMenu * item, unsigned int id )
to
void MainWindow::menuClicked( WidgetMenuPtr item, unsigned int id )



: error C2511: 'void MainWindow::menuClicked(SmartWin::WidgetFactory<Base,Parent>::WidgetMenuPtr,unsigned int)' : overloaded member function not found in 'MainWindow'
You will get this error if you forgot to change a predeclaration of the function,
possibly in the .h file if you changed it in the .cpp ?

********************************************************************************
						 Version 1.0.0, 10th of September 2005
********************************************************************************
- Return Type of all creational function in WidgetFactory have been changed to
  returning typedefed pointer for compatibility towards future versions in which
  the actual returned type might change!
  No WidgetXxx * itsWidget should now be used but rather WidgetXxxPtr itsWidget
  instead!!

- If you're adding up a CreationalStruct to your createXXX functions or the create
  functions of your widgets you need to explicitly add up WS_VISIBLE or the widget
  will initially be INVISIBLE!

- All Event Handlers which takes a Canvas of some type are now expected to take a
  reference to the base Canvas class instead of the derived type, meaning you might
  have to change signature of one of your Event Handlers taking e.g. FreeCanvas to
  taking just Canvas by reference.

- All Widget types have now implemeted all relevant Aspects meaning there will be
  virtually TONS of new functions on every single Widget type!

- New Aspect implemented in ALL Widgets!!
  AspectRaw which makes it possible to handle "generic" Events which there does NOT
  exist Event Handlers for by default.
  Look at SampleWidget (MainWindow.cpp) for an example of usage!!
  This Event Handler Setter makes it easier to handle "non handle able" Events without
  having to resort to overriding sendWidgetMessage!!

- Right clicking, Left clicking and Double Clicking in WidgetTreeView and WidgetDataGrid
  is now possible to handle.

- Library now uses boost instead of its own custom classes (SmartLib is removed)

- You can now query (AspectFont enabled) controls for their fonts

- You can now selectFont on the Canvas class which will change the Font used for
  rendering text.

- You can now query a WidgetDataGrid for its Cell Text value from an LPARAM, in addition
  there is now an Event Handler for trapping the Column Header Clicked event

- Added overridden constructor to class Brush taking a Bitmap shared_ptr which will
  be used when painting on the Brush as the background.
  To fill a surface with the Bitmap use Canvas::fillRectangle with the newly created
  Bitmap Brush.

- AspectPainting, there now exists an aspect called AspectPainting which is
  responsible for painting e.g. WidgetButton (created with BS_OWNERDRAW) and
  WidgetWindow.

- SmartWin++ does not any longer set deault creationalstruct parameters to default
  Widgets to be visible!
  This means you can create initially hidden Widgets for instance.

- New Widget, WidgetProgressBar is a ProgressBar Control which can be used to
  display the progress of lengthy jobs for instance.

- New Widget, WidgetMenuExtended is a more advanced menu type with LOTS of more
  capabilities then the default "normal" menu which is more boring, less colorful
  and more "dull".

- New Aspect for many Widgets, many Widgets now implements AspectBackgroundColor
  which makes it possible to set an eventhandler for the background color event
  which makes it possible to change the rendering of the background of Widgets.
  Basically meaning it's possible (among other things) to set the background color
  of all Widgets which realizes this Aspect.

- (Breaking) Moved the defaultCreationStruct OUT of the private_ namespace

- Added overloaded Constructor to Font class for using system fonts

- Lots of new samples, including some for Windows CE (PPC 2003 and SmartPhone 2003)

- Better directory structure for library

- Support for building applications for Pocket PC and Smart Phone Windows CE
  version 2003 and above with Visual C++ 2005 and above!
  Lots of Pocket PC example applications are included to help you here!

- The whole library has gotten way more cleaner code.

- There are now two new Widgets in library, one for choosing colors and another
  one for choosing fonts.
  Respectively called WidgetChooseColor and WidgetChooseFont

- There is now a Layout Management System in SmartWin++, partially in
  AspectSizable and partially in class SmartWin::Place.
  The name of the Place class might though change before the 1.0 release.

- Library and all sample applications now completely compiles with MingW/gcc 3.4.2
  Also we're working on getting it to compile with Wine meaning we will get an xNix
  implementation.


********************************************************************************
						 Version 0.999, 3.rd of May 2005
********************************************************************************
- The whole library has more or less been completely restructured and refactored.
  I don't' think this has however rendered any significant changes regarding
  backwards compatibility.

- The internals of the library now uses Signals and Slots (custom implementation
  which is utilized using Loki functors) for message handling and dispatching of
  messages.

- You can now build applications using Dev-Cpp version 4.9.9.2 which internally
  uses MingW/GCC version 3.4.2.
  xxx.dev files are included for both the library and all sample applications.
  You can probably also use other versions (close to) of the gcc MingW but
  this is the only one tested!

- WidgetModalDialog is added which is a modal dialog Widget

- Lots and lots of bugfixes, the library is now 100 times more conforming and
  probably in most ways way more stable then ever before.

- Several new sample applications, e.g. WidgetModalDialog also many existing
  sample applications have been extended.

- Support for the Whidbey VC++ 2005 compiler with specially solution files and
  project files. (VC++ 2005 uses different formats of the .vcproj files and
  the .sln files)

- The library has now officially changed name from just SmartWin to SmartWin++!

- Documentation is embedded in the download now.


********************************************************************************
								  Version 0.996
********************************************************************************
- Added up support for Threads (helper classes for guaranteeing serialized access) and
  support for forking current thread (AspectThreads)
  There are now three more classes (in threads.h) called Threads, ThreadLock and
  CriticalSection, Threads encapsulates a thread and it's operations, ThreadLock
  encapsulates and ensures locking and unlocking of a CriticalSection and CriticalSection
  encapsulates ensuring serialized access to shared resources among different threads.
  See the Threads project to get an example of how to use the classes...

- Fixed bug in setIcon, it didn't change the icon of the actual window, only the application
  if it was the only window in the app, now it works like it should thanx to kostasvl.

- Added up WidgetTabSheet, a naive implementation of a Tab Control with no helping sheet
  classes or anything fancy like that, but anyway it's a tab control implementation and it works!

- Fixed problems related to Dialogs which was visible in e.g. the WidgetFun. (the dialog didn't show up)

- Fixed a problem related to "hanging process" which was visible in all applications which used
  menus.


********************************************************************************
								  Version 0.995
********************************************************************************
- Added support for extracting Command Line params
  Application class has got a function called getCommandLine which returns an object
  that can be queried for the command line parameters.

- Added support for TEXT_CALLBACK list box, the WidgetDataGrid can now insert "PARAM ITEMS"
  which means that when the list needs to know the actual text of the items to display
  it will call a (must be) predefined Event Handler

- Added support for sorting the WidgetDataGrid Widget, the application defines an event
  handler which will be called to find out how items should be sorted.

- SmartWin now returns an error code (0xdeadbeef as in Dead Beef or in the Decimal system -559038737)
  to the OS when the application process exits if Memory Leaks are detected!
  This is true for both Debug builds and Release builds.

- Fixed so that when you have columns of different sizes in a WidgetDataGrid and rearranges the column
  order and then edit a column it actually places the edit control on the right position.
  This was a bug in 0.99 Release

- New Widget - WidgetSlider!
  WidgetSlider is a slide control also known as a TrackBar control.
  Useful for selecting input values between som sort of minimum/maximum value.
  Good examples are RGB values in color pickers in drawing programs.

- New Widget - WidgetSpinner!
  WidgetSpinner is a Spin Control, often used for the same things as the WidgetSlider.
  Takes less space on the screen then the WidgetSlider though

- Fixed bug
  There was a bug in UnicodeConverter<char, wchar_t>::doConvert which caused bullshit data
  to be returned if given an empty string to convert, this bug is fixed.

- New Widget - WidgetMDIParent!
  WidgetMDIParent is a MDI Client Widget.
  Now you can use the MDI (Multi Document Interface) control with SmartWin.

- New Widget - WidgetMDIChild
  WidgetMDIChild is a child Widget to put into the WidgetMDIParent to be able to use
  the MDI (Multi Document Interface) with SmartWin

- Design by Contract!
  Added three "contracts" through use of Policies (Policy Based Design) which takes all the
  logic which is different from a MessageMap for a MDIChildWindow, DialogWindow and "normal" window
  and separated it out into three policy classes called DialogWidget, NormalWidget && MessageMapPolicyMDIChildWidget.
  This will make things change a bit regarding your inheritence string (from WidgetFactory)
  Now if you want to have a class describing a DialogWidget you need to derive from: "WidgetFactory<WidgetDialog, X>"
  where X is your class instead of WidgetWindow as before, same for WidgetMDIIChild which needs to supply
  WidgetMDIChild instead of WidgetWindow as before.
  Basically the gain from this is that it will be impossible to call e.g. subclassButton from a WidgetFacory derived
  class which does NOT supply WidgetDialog as it first template parameter, same for createDialog will
  only exist in WidgetDialog and create will only exist in WidgetWindow.

- Fixed a bug in the unicode conversion class (from char to wchar_t didn't work at all)
  (Thank you Sergey)

- Renamed the setIcon function and made TWO functions, one called setIconSmall and another called
  setIconLarge (which I assume users will understand what the difference between is)
  The small icon is the icon that shows in e.g. upper left corner of the Widget and the large icon is
  the icon which shows when you e.g. press ALT + Tab
  (Thank you Sergey)

- New Aspect - AspectUpdate
  The AspectUpdate class is for Widgets that can update their text properties, e.g. the WidgetText implements
  the AspectUpdate, it declares two event handler setters (one global and one member function) which cna be set to
  be called every time the text property of the WidgetTexctBox changes

- Removed the Diamond Inheritance from Widget away from all Aspect classes.
  (thank you Sergey)

- I've outfactored everything specific to the different types of MainWidgets (Dialog, MDI && Normal Window) now
  to the specific policy classes.

- Removed the mainWndProc function (sendWidgetMessage now is the member function to use)

- Added support for trapping the event onSetText in the AspectText Aspect.
